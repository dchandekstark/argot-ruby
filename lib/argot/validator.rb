    # Implementation of a rule that can be loaded from a data file.  Supported attributes:

    # * +name+ : (required) the name and short description of a rule.
    # * +path+ : (required) the path within an argot document to the field this rule handles
    #   e.g. +title.main+ refers to the +main+ attribute of the top-level +title+ attribute.
    # * +required+ : (optional, defaults to +false+) whether the field must be present in the document.
    # * +type+ : (optional) - the expected Ruby type of object at +path+, e.g. +String+ or +Fixnum+.
    # * +single+ : (optional, defaults to +false+) - there should only be 1 value
    #   this attribute is only used to check validity if the field is present.  If left
    #   unspecfied, no type checking will be done.
    #
    # === YAML
    # rules can be specified in a YAML file using the syntax:
    #  - name : 'Title' attribute must be present
    #    path : title
    #    required : true
    #    
    #  - name : 'local_id' attribute is required
    #    path : local_id
    #    required: true
    #    type : string
    # 
    # The above defines two rules, one of which checks for the existence of a 'title' attribute that
    # can have any value, and the other which verfies the presence of a +local_id+ attribute that is a 
    # ruby String (i.e. if local_id is itself an object, this rule would be violated)
